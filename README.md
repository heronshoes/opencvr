# opencvr: Ruby binding of OpenCV

## About this library

opencvr is a ruby extension library which provides the wrapper of OpenCV.

## Tiny sample

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'cv2'

# Read a JPEG file
img = CV2::imread("input.jpg")
# draw a circle of radius: 100 at position (200, 200) with blue color
# (BGR: 255, 0, 0), thickness: 3 and antialiased
CV2::circle(img, [200, 200], 50, [255, 0, 0], thickness: 3, lineType: CV2::LINE_AA)
# Save to out.jpg
CV2::imwrite("out.jpg", img)
```

## How to create binding code

opencvr generates binding code with the similar way of python binding, which is officially provided by OpenCV.

To provide ruby API of C/C++ library, we need to write binding code for each API (functions, enums, etc.). OpenCV has many APIs, so it would be an exhausting task if we manually write all binding codes.

To avoid this problem, python binding codes are automatically generated by reading header files of C++ interface. opencvr uses similar way and reuse some scripts of python binding generator.

## Supported features

See [Support Status](./SupportStatus.md).

Here is an example of supported functions.

* `cv::imread()`
* `cv::imwrite()`
* `cv::arrowedLine()`
* `cv::circle()`

## cv::Mat and Numo::NArray

cv::Mat is the matrix class used in OpenCV, but in python binding `ndarray` of Numpy is used, which is widely used in python world. It enables easily combining other libraries, such as data science and machine learning libraries.

In opencvr, `Numo::NArray` is used as matrix library because it's widely used in ruby world.

## Future plan

* Support more classes, functions, etc.
* Create gem

## How to install

### From gem

opencvr gem has not been created yet.

### Build from source

#### Prerequisites

Below components are required to build opencvr:

* Ruby (>3.0.0)
  * recommend to use rbenv
* Python (>3.x)
* OpenCV
  * `libopencv-dev` (apt package on Ubuntu-20.04)
  * `opencv` (brew package on macOS)

#### Build

Ubuntu

```
$ ruby extconf.rb  # Makefile and headers.txt are generated
$ ./gen2rb.py headers.txt
$ make
```

macOS

```
$ ruby extconf.rb  # Makefile and headers.txt are generated
$ ./gen2rb.py headers.txt
$ make CXXFLAGS="-std=c++14"
```

#### Run test

```
$ test/bind-test1.rb
```
